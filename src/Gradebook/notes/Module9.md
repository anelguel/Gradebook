# Object-oriented Programming with C#

### The Pillars of OOP
* Encapsulation - allows us to hide details about our code (methods and properties), and access modifier give us control over encapsulation and who sees the members of a class
* Inheritance - gives us the ability to reuse code across similar classes
* Polymorphism - allows us to have objects of the same type that can behave differently

### Deriving from a Base Class
* Inheritance allows you to define a base class. Any members that I write in a base class, I can inherit into a dervied class and allow those base class members to effectively be members of my derived class.
* DRY principle= Don't Repeat Yourself
