# Object-oriented Programming with C#

### The Pillars of OOP
* Encapsulation - allows us to hide details about our code (methods and properties), and access modifier give us control over encapsulation and who sees the members of a class
* Inheritance - gives us the ability to reuse code across similar classes
* Polymorphism - allows us to have objects of the same type that can behave differently
