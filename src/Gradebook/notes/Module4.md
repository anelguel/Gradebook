## Module 4: Working with Classes and Objects
### Creating a Class
Talked about namespace, and mentioned that a class defines a new type (just like a list, array, Console, etc.)

## Adding State and Behavior
You can have as many classes as you want in a namespace, but the convention is to add *one* class per file (in this case, Program.cs or namespace)
A class consists two things: the state or data it holds (property), and then there is the behavior (method) which acts on that state
