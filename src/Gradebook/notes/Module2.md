# Module 2: Learning the C# Syntax

## Reviewing Your Assignment
**Assignment**: We need an electronic grade book to read the scores of an indivudual student and then compute some simple statistics from the scores.
The grades are entered as floating point numbers from 0 to 100, and the statistics should show us the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the average grade.

## Working with Code Blocks and Statements
`;` - tells the compiler where one statement starts and another ends
When debugging, skip problems in `.csproj` and instead see errors in `.cs` files. Start with first/earliest errors and work down, as some errors are caused by previous errors. You can see what lines the errors occured in the debug console.
