# Module 8: Building Types

### Overloading Methods
Classes have members (fields, methods). Methods can have the same name, but the parameter has to be different. However, two identical methods with the same parameters but different return type will fail to compile.

### Defining Properties
Another type of member is a property. A property is similar to a field in that it can encapsulate state and it can store data for an object.
