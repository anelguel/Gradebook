# Module 7: Controlling the Flow of Execution

### Branching with if Statements
* `&&` and
* `||` or
* `==` equal, compares if two things are equal, different than assigning with `=`

### Looping with for, foreach, do, and while
 * `index += 1;` is the same thing as `index++;`

 The difference between `do-while` and `while`:
    * A `do{} while{}` loop will always execute atleast one time through, because we do not check the condition until we reach the end of the block of code (the while).
     * A `while{}` statement will first check if the statement is true. If so, then it will execute the proceeding logic, otherwise it will not.

`for`:
    * The first part is the initialization expression. You can declare or initialize a variable, or declare AND initialize a variable that I'm going to be using throughout the rest of the loop.
    * The second part is the condition to check before the runtime enters the loop.
    * The third part is the operation I want to perform after each iteration of the loop.
